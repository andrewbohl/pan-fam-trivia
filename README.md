This is a fun side project to suprise my family in hosting our bi-weekly covid zoom trivia game.

To run you'll need to start both the backend and frontend using
```
cd backend 
npm run dev
```

in a new terminal
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend websocket on localhost:3000 and the frontend on localhost:5000
